Welcome to Economix ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our platform, including our website (https://economix.lol), services, and features such as trading, chatting, and gaming (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information to provide and improve the Service:

### 1.1 Personal Information
- **Account Information**: When you register or log in, we collect your username and a hashed version of your password. If you enable two-factor authentication (2FA), we may also collect your email address or phone number for verification purposes.
- **Profile Information**: You may optionally provide additional details such as a profile picture, bio, or cosmetic preferences (e.g., messageplates and nameplates), which may be visible to other users.
- **Transaction Data**: When you engage in activities like trading items, sending tokens, or participating in auctions, we collect details about these transactions, including item IDs, token amounts, and timestamps.
- **Communication Data**: Messages you send in chat rooms (e.g., global, exclusive, or staff chats) are collected, including content, timestamps, and your username.

### 1.2 Automatically Collected Information
- **Device and Usage Data**: We collect information about your device, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and usage patterns (e.g., pages visited, time spent on features like the marketplace or casino).
- **Cookies and Tracking Technologies**: We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, track usage, and improve the Service. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.
- **Log Data**: Our servers log actions such as login attempts, item creation, and chat activity for security and moderation purposes.

### 1.3 Information from Third Parties
- **Authentication Services**: If you link your Economix account to third-party services (e.g., Discord for support), we may receive limited information like your Discord ID.
- **Payment Processors**: If you purchase gems or upgrade to PRO/PRO+ plans, payment processors may provide us with transaction confirmation details (though we do not store full payment information).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to operate, maintain, and enhance the Service, including:

- **Account Management**: To create and manage your account, authenticate logins, and secure your profile with features like 2FA.
- **Service Delivery**: To enable trading, chatting, gaming (e.g., casino games), pet management, and other interactive features.
- **Communication**: To send you notifications (e.g., about trades or bans), respond to inquiries, and moderate chat rooms.
- **Security and Fraud Prevention**: To detect and prevent cheating, spam, or abuse, using IP addresses, logs, and automated moderation tools (e.g., AutoMod).
- **Analytics and Improvement**: To analyze usage trends, improve features (e.g., marketplace dynamics), and develop new content.
- **Leaderboards and Social Features**: To display your username and stats (e.g., tokens, level) on leaderboards or in chats, unless you opt for private settings.
- **Legal Compliance**: To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal requests.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. However, we may share it in these cases:

- **With Other Users**: Your username, profile details, chat messages, and transaction history (e.g., items sold) may be visible to other users as part of the Service.
- **Service Providers**: We share data with third-party providers (e.g., hosting services, MongoDB for database storage) to operate the Service. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements.
- **Moderation and Support**: Moderators and administrators may access your data (e.g., chat logs, IP addresses) to enforce rules or investigate reports.
- **Legal Obligations**: We may disclose information to comply with laws, respond to subpoenas, or protect our rights and the safety of others.
- **Business Transfers**: If Economix is involved in a merger or acquisition, your information may be transferred to the new entity.
- **Public Platforms**: Links to our GitHub repository and Discord server are provided, but we do not share your data with these platforms unless you choose to engage with them separately.

## 4. Data Protection and Security

We prioritize the security of your information and implement the following measures:

- **Encryption**: We use military-grade encryption to protect data during transmission and storage (e.g., password hashing, secure API calls).
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional 2FA adds an extra layer of account security using time-based codes.
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized personnel (e.g., admins) can access sensitive data, and access is logged.
- **AutoMod**: Automated systems monitor for spam, fraud, and abuse, blocking suspicious IPs or accounts.
- **Regular Updates**: We perform ongoing security audits and updates to address vulnerabilities.

Despite these efforts, no online service is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access.

- **Access and Correction**: Update your username, profile details, or cosmetic preferences via the settings tab.
- **Data Portability**: Request a copy of your account data (e.g., items, tokens) by contacting us.
- **Deletion**: Delete your account through the settings tab, subject to retention for legal or security purposes (e.g., ban records).
